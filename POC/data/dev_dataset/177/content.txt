Contact Us    About Chimaera   The idea for Chimaera emerged during the doctoral studies of co-founders Dr. Marcus Prümmer, Dr. Dieter Hahn and Dr. Volker Daum together with their mentor and supervisor Prof. Dr. Joachim Hornegger. Based on their many years of experience in machine learning research, they recognized the challenges of providing valuable services and developing the right software tools for image processing and artificial intelligence projects more than fifteen years ago.   This experience has now also extended to annotating and curating training data for AI projects. Starting with custom software development, Chimaera's portfolio has steadily expanded. Today, Chimaera is a reliable partner for research, industry and medium-sized businesses. About Us   References     Questions & Answers   Q&A: How can you support me in my clinical research study?
