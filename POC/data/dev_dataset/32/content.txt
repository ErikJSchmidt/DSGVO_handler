EN EN DE WE MOVE IMAGES Watch Showreel Willkommen WE CREATE MOVEMENT With experience and creativity, we have been covering the entire spectrum of visual communication since 1991 focusing on corporate and product videos, interactive training media, presentation and event support, as well as individual media installations.  ​  The purposes of our productions are nevertheless diverse and include, for example, internal & external communication, marketing & PR, online, social media, exhibition & events and arts & culture. CONCEPT We want to understand ideas and interests to bring them to life. An active and inspiring cooperation is key to us. CAMERA Our camera captures unexpected details, but also the bigger picture. Coherences become visible, hidden things can be discovered. EDITING With editing we determine the rhythm, the flow of the images and the course of the story. ANIMATION Animations help to focus.  Ideas become tangible and visually comprehensible. SOUNDDESIGN Music and sounds, woven into collages that emphasize the impression of the pictures. MEDIA INSTALLATIONS We move images in space and spaces in images.  Media installations create stunning experiences.

Instead of eternal stories, we provide you with individual and convincing media solutions. From the World Heritage city of Bamberg, we know where our roots lie, but we are able to react and act internationally.    ag4 medien GmbH was founded in Cologne in 1991 to produce film, video and new media. The ag4 media emerged from a group of architects, designers and media makers as a working group for 4-dimensional construction.  ​  Our goal is to visualize complex content in an aesthetic and understandable way. We want to arouse curiosity and interest in the viewer and leave a lasting impression.
