                                                use of certain functions (e.g. map function) or to improve the user

                                                        provided by “Google”. “Google Maps” enables the convenient use
                                                        of the map feature on our website. When the map feature is used,
                                                        information is also processed which is stored on users’ devices.
                                                        By visiting the website, “Google” receives the information that

                                                        of the server request – is transmitted to “Google”. This occurs
                                                        regardless of whether “Google” provides a user account that
                                                        users are logged in with or whether no user account exists. If
