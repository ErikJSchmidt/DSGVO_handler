This folder contains the pretrained language detection model used to tag websites with the used language.
FastText was used. The python api is importex in 2_automated_dataset_completion.ipynb and the model was downloaded from https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/language-identification.html .

The downloaded file lid.176.bin is too large to be uploaded to git. Therefore, it is excluded in .gitignore
